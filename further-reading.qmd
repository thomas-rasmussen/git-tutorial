# Further reading

The [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs){target="_blank"} is always a good place to start if you want to learn more about what commands are available and how they work. In particular, the freely available book [Pro Git]( https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2){target="_blank"} is well worth a read. Beside that, here is a short list of curated resources that could be of interest:
